         <p> Even though the listed hobbies mostly relate to the indoors activities I can't live a day without going outside.
         </br>
         For example, I have a couple of friends with whom I'm hanging out almost every day in a free time. </br>
         Together we can go to the swimming pool, sauna, play football or just visit a restaurant in the evening. </br>
         So, I have both extroverted and introverted natures and I'm very happy that there's a balance between them in my
         life! </p>
         <p> Finally, I can't help but say that the key guideline in my life is self-development. That is, I believe that I
         can achieve the maximum </br>
         level of happiness and satisfaction from life by comprehending something new, expanding the horizons of my
         existing knowledge. </br>
         Actually, that's why I'm here now doing this homework and discovering a new world of IT with small but confident
         steps &#128578
