<h3> Current location </h3>
<p>I've been living in Norway for last two years, but before I moved here I'd lived in the northern part of Russia </p>

<h3> Hobbies and own interests</h3>
<ul>
<li> Making music in Fl Studio </li>   
<li> Exploration and speculations on crypto market</li>
<li> Reading the works of famous sociologists and philosophers</li>
<li> Gym at least two times in a week</li>
</ul>
<p> Even though the listed hobbies mostly relate to the indoors activities I can't live a day without going outside. </br>
For example, I have a couple of friends with whom I'm hanging out almost every day in a free time. </br>
Together we can go to the swimming pool, sauna, play football  or just visit a restaurant in the evening. </br>
So, I have both extroverted and introverted natures and I'm very happy that there's a balance between them in my life! </p>
<p> Finally, I can't help but say that the key guideline in my life is self-development. That is, I believe that I can achieve the maximum </br>
level of happiness and satisfaction from life by comprehending something new, expanding the horizons of my existing knowledge. </br>
Actually, that's why I'm here now doing this homework and discovering a new world of IT with small but confident steps &#128578
